== Compilation ==
It is advisable to install a stable Cemono version before compiling from source. These files can be downloaded from https://github.com/downloads/samneirinck/cemono/cemono-base.zip

Open /src/Cemono.sln with Visual Studio 2010 or above, and build all projects
All projects have their output set to the /output directory, look in there for the compiled assemblies.

== Installation ==
Assuming your game is in c:\games\mygame\ (<mygamedirectory>) [NOTE: Not the /Game directory, but the root game folder)
Go to the /output folder and copy the files:

- Cemono.Bcl.dll 		-> <mygamedirectory>\engine\lib\cemono
- Cemono.Manager.dll 	-> <mygamedirectory>\engine\lib\cemono
- bin32\Cemono.dll		-> <mygamedirectory>\bin32
- bin32\CryGame.dll		-> <mygamedirectory>\bin32
