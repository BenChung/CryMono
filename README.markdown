CryMono (v1.0 pre-alpha) - Mono game logic support for CryENGINE3
	by Ink Studios Ltd. (Based on 'cemono' by Sam 'ins\' Neirinck)

# Description
CryMono brings the power of C# into the world of CryENGINE3, allowing game logic to be scripted in a faster and easier to use lanaguage than Lua.
	
## Using CryMono 
In order to use CryMono, you'll need to download one of our publicly available samples;

* <a href="https://github.com/inkdev/CryMono-Mini-Game-Sample">MiniGame sample</a> - A C# CryENGINE minigame sample built using a skeleton game dll
* <a href="https://github.com/inkdev/CryMono-Game-Sample">CryGame sample</a> - The default CryENGINE project with CryMono built-in.

### Documentation
For instructions on all things CryMono, see our Confluence setup at <a href="http://docs.inkdev.net/display/CryMono/Home">docs.inkdev.net</a>.

#### Source directory structure 
Our Visual Studio projects have been set up to expect all contents to be placed inside a folder within the Code folder shipped with the CryENGINE Free SDK.

Example:
D:\Dev\INK\CryENGINE\Code\CryMono

Using another folder structure is up to the developer, but will require customization in order for reference and output locations to be correct.

### Debugging managed code
Debugging managed (C#) code is not supported yet, but will be supported in the near future.
