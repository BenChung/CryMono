== Using SampleGame ==
To utilize the sample game project; copy the Bin32, Bin64, Engine and Game directories in your engine root and run the Editor.

SampleGame is in no means bug-free, and only exists as a sample of how a CryMono game project can be set up.

== Compiling SampleGame ==
GameDll source can be found in the GameDll directory, whereas source to the CryGameLibrary (containing CryGame-specific scriptbinds etc) can be found in the CryGameLibrary.

Solution files are located in CryMono root. (MonoGameSample.sln + express variations)
