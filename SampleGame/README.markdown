== Using SampleGame ==
A precompiled version of SampleGame and CryMono can be located [[https://github.com/inkdev/CryMono/downloads|here]]. Simply drop the contents of the zip into your engine root, and run the Editor.

SampleGame is in no means bug-free, and only exists as a sample of how a CryMono game project can be set up.

== Compiling SampleGame ==
GameDll source can be found in the GameDll directory, whereas source to the CryGameLibrary (containing CryGame-specific scriptbinds etc) can be found in the CryGame solution.

Solution files are located in CryMono root. (MonoGameSample.sln + express variations)
